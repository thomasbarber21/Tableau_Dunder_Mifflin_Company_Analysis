This Dashboard was created to analyze the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It utilizes Tableau's data visualization techniques to find insights within the data.

To view the final dashboard simply select the png file. I have also included the Tableau Workbook file as well. The interactive nature of the dashboard can be explored through that file, or it is also available on my Tableau Public profile linked below.
